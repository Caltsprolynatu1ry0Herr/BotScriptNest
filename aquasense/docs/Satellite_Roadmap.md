## Roadmap: Satellite Imagery Integration
- Future plans to incorporate satellite imagery analysis (e.g., chlorophyll levels, algal blooms) to complement ground-based sensor data for broader coverage.
- AI models to correlate satellite observations with in-situ sensor readings for comprehensive insights.
